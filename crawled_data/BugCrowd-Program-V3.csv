Failure to Invalidate Session > On Password Reset and/or Change  Please note, other authorization and session-based vulnerabilities can be valuable 
HTML Injection is of limited value to the team, please focus on other XXS type findings

","Testing is only authorized on the targets listed as In-Scope. _Any domain/property of Redox not listed in the targets section is out of scope. This includes any/all subdomains not listed above. IF you happen to identify a security vulnerability on a target that is not in-scope, but that demonstrably belongs to Redox, it may be reported to this program, and is appreciated - but will ultimately be marked as 'not applicable' and will not be eligible for monetary or points-based compensation.

DDoS and DoS Vulnerabilities
DDoS Vulnerabilities are out of scope of this program (ie. any attack requiring more than a small number of resources) DoS vulnerabilities which cause application ""slowdown"" will be considered P5/Informational, unless the researcher can demonstrate that the bug is severe enough to disable OTHER sessions and site functionality without a large number of resources. Bugs which cannot clearly show the impact on OTHER users without significant resources will be considered DDoS.

Subdomain Takeovers
Subdomain takeovers require proof of takeover. Please include a screenshot of the domain taken over temporarily. Subdomains explicitly listed in the target list below will be awarded as a P2, other domains will be awarded as a P3.

Customer and Third Party Applications
While customer and third-party applications built on Redox are technically out of scope, we will support the responsible disclosure of any issue and support forwarding these problems to the third party. For this reason we encourage you to submit these issues if you find them during your testing (such as key to our API a customer posts to GitHub) and we may offer discretionary rewards in these cases.

AWS S3 Buckets not clearly linked to Redox. (This does not include buckets with ""redox"" in their name) any submissions must include how the bucket name is linked to Redox (from documentation, code or application links) or it will be rejected as out of scope.

Multiple recurrences of the same vulnerability on different domains will be treated as the same issue.
We are already aware of issues related to rate limiting in the authentication subsystem 
Google Maps API keys
Session valid after logout and password change/reset
Cookie expiration
Software version disclosure
Same site scripting
Social engineering and phishing
Multiple recurrences of the same vulnerability on different domains
Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) in non-sensitive functions
Missing/misconfigured SPF/DMARC DNS-records
Denial of service or resource exhaustion attacks (but such vulnerabilities in proprietary applications should be reported)
Weak or misconfigured SSL/TLS parameters
Content spoofing
Issues related to rate limiting in the authentication subsystem
Issues related to cross-domain policies for software such as Wordpress, Silverlight, etc. without evidence of an exploitable vulnerability
Vulnerabilities that are limited to unsupported browsers will not be accepted (i.e. ""this exploit only works in IE6/IE7"")
Username / email enumeration, password guessing and exposed API interfaces (like xmlrpc.php) in standard software (i.e. Wordpress)
Vulnerabilities that require a large amount of user cooperation to perform, unlikely or unreasonable actions which would be more symptomatic of a social engineering or phishing attack and not an application vulnerability (e.g. disabling browser security features, sending the attacker critical information to complete the attack, etc.)
